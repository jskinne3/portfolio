      <h2>On being not afraid</h2>

      Before all the bars here in New York State were closed last week, a lot of people kept going to them when the risk of Coronavirus was quickly escalating. Reporters asked them why; people explained it's because they were not afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can understand that impulse. I think about my friend <a href="https://clas.uiowa.edu/geography/people/barbara-kagima">Barbara</a>, who was working from a coffee shop in a mall in Nairobi, Kenya in 2013 when terrorists attacked. She only narrowly survived the attack; many others did not survive.
    </p>
    <p>
      This did not stop Barbara from going to coffee shops. I visited her in Kenya not long afterward. We went to malls and coffee shops and bars together, even though we (and especially she) were keenly aware that deadly attack was a possibility in any public place. All of Nairobi knew it, but the city's amazing nightlife didn't pause.

    <p>
      Another story: I went to a party in a cornfield in rural Nebraska the summer I was 19. Some guy at the party threatened me and attempted to attack me with a hammer because he believed I was gay. I fled for my life, and walked three miles home, barefoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      That experience didn't stop me from going to parties. It did not stop me doing things that make me seem gay, or from living in Nebraska.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would not say I am unafraid of attack by terrorists or homophobes, but evidently I'm not so afraid as to change my behavior much. I don't think this is an uncommon attitude. People routinely accept risks like these in exchange for a fun evening at a bar. It feels good: defiant, vital, adventurous.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this time, I'm staying home. Because THIS SITUATION IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. People going out to a bar now are not taking a calculated risk upon themselves; they are putting others at risk who have not agreed to accept that risk. The exponential growth potential of infection greatly magnifies risk &mdash; you can now do way, way more harm to others than you can possibly do to yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saying you are "not afraid" of that is saying that you are not afraid of hurting people. New Yorkers who were not afraid are now watching the corpses pile up.
