      Inspired by <a href="https://www.cassey.dev/favorite-mugs/">Cassey Lottman's</a> and <a href="https://rovingthoughts.com/articles/my-favorite-mugs/">Zach LeBar's</a> blog posts about their favorite mugs, here are my favorites:
    </p>

      <figcaption class="block">A coffee mug which reads: The Salvation of the State is Watchfulness in the Citizen</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      This mug features the text of <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Salvation_of_the_State_is_Watchfulness_in_the_Citizen.jpg">an inscription</a> on the Nebraska State Capitol building, set in a very pleasing typeface by <a href="https://www.justinkemerling.com/">Justin Kemerling</a>. It is just the right size for me &mdash; I like my coffee mugs on the smaller side, so that I can keep refilling them with hot coffee.

      I got this mug for a couple bucks at a thrift store as a gift for someone with a quirky sense of humor. I never gave it to her because I love it too much. Sunlight coming through the milk-glass soothes me each morning. This is the mug I use most often.

      <img class="shadow block" src="/img/mug3.jpg" alt="A mug with a picture of Freddie Mercury wearing a crown" />

      This was a thoughtful gift from my partner, Misha. It's a little bigger than the mugs I prefer for coffee, but it's great for tea. Gazing upon Freddie's glory in the morning makes me happy.

      I wrote this because I miss the era when bloggers shared random thoughts and there was no social media trying to monetize our every impulse. I am reminding myself this is still <a href="https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/the-subversive-hyperlink/">a web of magic links that corporations can't control</a>. If I have inspired you to blog about something low-stakes and fun, <a href="https://carhenge.club/@skiles">tell me about it on Mastodon</a>.
